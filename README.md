## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer
- Git

**Required PHP Extensions:**
- intl
- mbstring
- json

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomaswinchestar/ironsoft-test.git
cd ironsoft-test
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Configure Environment (Optional)

Copy the environment file and update if needed:

```bash
cp env .env
```

Edit `.env` to configure:
- `app.baseURL` - Your application URL (default: `http://localhost:8080/`)
- Database settings (if needed)

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
php spark serve
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

## Alternative: Using PHP Built-in Server

```bash
cd public
php -S localhost:8080
```

## Production Deployment

For production deployment to web servers (Apache/Nginx), see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## Navigation Menu

The navigation includes:

- **PRODUCTS** (dropdown)
  - All Products → `/products`
  - IronPDF for Java → `/products/java`
  - IronPDF for Python → `/products/python`
  - IronPDF for NodeJS → `/products/nodejs`
- **FEATURES** → `/features`
- **ABOUT US** → `/about`
- **CAREER** → `/career`

## JSON Data Source

The application uses `app/Data/site_data.json` as a simulated data source containing:

- Site metadata (title, description, keywords)
- Navigation menu items and dropdowns
- Hero section content
- Early access section content
- Features list
- Products list with status (released/coming soon)
- Footer CTA content

## Pages Overview

### Home Page (`/`)
Main landing page with hero banner, early access signup, features section, why section, and clickable product cards.

### Product Pages (`/products/java`, `/products/python`, `/products/nodejs`)
Individual product pages with "Early Access" styling, product description, and all product cards displayed.

### Career Page (`/career`)
Job listings page with open positions displayed in product card style.

### Features Page (`/features`)
Detailed features section for IronPDF capabilities.

### About Page (`/about`)
Information about why Iron Software created the C++ PDF library.

## CodeIgniter 4 Best Practices

1. **Folder Structure**: Follows CI4's recommended directory layout
2. **Controllers**: Extend BaseController for shared functionality
3. **Views**: Organized in subdirectories by feature
4. **Routing**: Centralized route definitions in `Config/Routes.php`
5. **Data Separation**: JSON data file separate from controllers
6. **Assets**: Static files in public directory
7. **Security**: Front controller pattern prevents direct file access

## Quality Assurance

See `QA_CHECKLIST.md` for comprehensive testing guidelines covering:
- Pixel alignment & spacing
- Typography accuracy
- Responsiveness across devices
- Cross-browser compatibility
- SEO validation
- Core Web Vitals
- Lighthouse audit criteria
- Functional testing
